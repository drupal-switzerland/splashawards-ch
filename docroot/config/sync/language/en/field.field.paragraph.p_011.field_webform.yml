label: Form
description: "You can easily add a form by selecting any pre-made ones from the dropdown.<br>\r\nUse the 'Scheduled' status if you would like to make a form available in the future or 'Closed' to prevent new submissions. Both options will display a message to the visitor.<br>\r\nYou can use the 'default submission data' field to prefill any of the form fields if you are familiar with using YAML and Drupal tokens (follow the example)."
